# Roles and Their Responsibilities 
## "Who does what?"

Clearly define the roles of committee members (e.g., Chair, Mentorship Lead, Skill Area Leads) and their decision-making authority.

### Key Roles

- Committee Chair: Schedules and oversees meetings, ensures alignment with company's strategy.
- Mentorship Lead: Owns mentorship programs with deputy mentors
for specific skill areas (e.g., AI, backend, DevOps).
- Process Improvement Owner: Responsible for feedback loops, metrics, and continuous improvement. Both internal engineering processes as well as HR+mentorship processes.

CEO Expectations: clearly document time commitments, term limits, and rotation policies (eg how often do we rotate the Chair?)
